                <h1>What is Steam</h1>
            </header>
            <br>Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.

Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could ♥♥♥♥ing fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you.

                        it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours, enjoyed with friends, had some unforgettably entertaining moments in, and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.

however, thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.

when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot [relatively] new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync, start game lag, etc). since then, the early access game has gone gold, introduced a new map, added cosmetics and taunts, changed balance in weapons, addressed cheats, etc. the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.

the problem? the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed. at this point, given the focus of the dev team, this signals to me that it will likely never change.

the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre-game items. to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed, just worked around. the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.

ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens. the likelihood is that more often than not someone [typically the one on the receiving end ;)] is shaking their head and it genuinely doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.

as a comparison, take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive. you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid. the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill, not engine quirks.

when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march - having played only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say: https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissCaringSowHoneyBadger:

"after playing on LAN you come back to this, you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game [...] if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN, online, ho-my-god. it would be a dream."

it's 2018.

2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability in perspective as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.

Okay, now I'm going to get serious. After having this review up for multiple months about starter edition, I want to really talk about the game. This is honestly a great game, but two main things really throw me off. 
1. THE COMMUNITY. People in matchmaking can be so toxic sometimes, and it can really get on your nerves. The reporting system doesn't work unless a lot of people actually report that person.
2. The matchmaking. Oh, how this has pained me. You always get put with a team that doesn't communicate, earrapes you, or is toxic as hell, and have to kill a team of plats and ping abusers. It's not fun. Ranking up relies on luck and timing.
Also, think of the starter edition. It's a trap to get even more money than the full game. Yes, it is cheaper, but it takes three times as long just to get a new operator. It's a trap that me and many other people have fallen into.

BUT. On a lighter note, this game is pretty fun. You can meet some nice people and make new friends. While there are many bugs and issues, the core concept of the game keeps me and many other people playing.

                        Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson, maintained by Mojang AB, and part of Microsoft Studios. It is heavily inspired by Infiniminer.

From its creation, Minecraft was developed almost exclusively by Notch until Jens "Jeb" Bergensten started working with him, and has since become head of its development. It features music by Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld and paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand. Initially released as what is now known as Minecraft Classic on May 17, 2009, the game was released as Minecraft 1.0 on November 18, 2011. Since its release, Minecraft has expanded to mobile devices and consoles. On November 6, 2014, Minecraft and all of Mojang's assets were acquired by Microsoft.

                    <div class="content">
                        Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is an action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4 in May 2016. Following Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, it is the final Uncharted game to feature protagonist Nathan Drake (portrayed by Nolan North). Drake, retired from fortune hunting with his wife Elena, reunites with his estranged older brother Sam and longtime partner Sully to search for Captain Henry Avery's lost treasure.

The game features larger and more open levels than previous Uncharted games; players have more freedom to explore and move in combat, progress through enemy encounters undetected using stealth, and can use vehicles. Sony revealed Uncharted 4 at the North America PlayStation 4 launch event in November 2013. Development was hampered by extensive script changes and reshoots following the departures of lead Uncharted writer and creative director Amy Hennig and director Justin Richmond in March 2014. Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, who had directed Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us, became the directors.

                    <div class="content">
                        Call of Duty: WWII is a first-person shooter video game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on November 3, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the fourteenth main installment in the Call of Duty series and the first title in the series to be set primarily during World War II since Call of Duty: World at War in 2008.[2]

The game's campaign is set in the European theatre, and is centered around a squad in the 1st Infantry Division, following their battles on the Western Front, and set mainly in the historical events of Operation Overlord. The player controls Ronald "Red" Daniels, who has squadmates that can supply the player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades; none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign. The multiplayer mode features map locations not seen in the campaign. The mode also features the new Divisions system, replacing the create-a-class system that previous games in the series used. A social hub, Headquarters, was also implemented into the game, allowing for players to interact with each other.
